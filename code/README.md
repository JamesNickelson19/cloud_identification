This section contains all code used in this project. 

Source code (codes that are ran in the other documents): 

fits_processing.py : contains the actual code behind the project, and has functions for manipulating the FIT images and training and running the algorithms. Examples of the code in use are commented out at the bottom of the document

Child code (code that runs off the source code):

get_training_data.py : contains the code used to extract the training data from the FIT files, and produce a .csv file

get_test_data.py : same thing as with get_training_data.py, just with the test data

train_models.py : contains the code used for training the models. Please note that this code doesn't work at this time

test_models.py : contains the code for testing the models, and producing a graph showcasing how their accuracies change over time
