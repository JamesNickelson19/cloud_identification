This is the section that the processed png images are saved to. Since they have the overlays that make marking clouds in the images as convenient as I can get it, they are quite important.

I won't be uploading anything to this section, same as with the FIT images folder, as there is just too much. To recreate my code as I have it set up, folders should, again, be made for the images at each stage of the training process (20, 40, 80 etc.)
