This section contains all the models that I trained (20, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 450 images) of both the LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms. The test algorithms are the ones produced at the bottom of the fits_processing.py document (those sections are commented out), and aren't actually used in the rest of this process.
