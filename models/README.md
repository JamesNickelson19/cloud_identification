This section contains ALL the models that I trained (20, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 450 images) of both the LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms. 

ALL trained models are in this section, including the ones from the section on improving accuracy. For the base models, look for the versions that end in just test.pickle
